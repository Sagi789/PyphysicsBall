Welcome to PyphysicsBall, an interactive physics sandbox built with Pygame! Dive into a world of realistic ball physics with gravity, collision detection, and special effects. Whether you're a budding game developer, a student looking to explore physics concepts, or just someone who enjoys interactive simulations, PyphysicsBall has something for everyone.

## 📁 Repository Contents

1. `main.py` - The main Python file containing the game logic.
2. `constants.py` - File with constant variables used throughout the game.
3. `utils.py` - Utility functions for physics calculations.
4. `assets/` - Directory containing all the game assets such as images and sounds.

## 🌟 Features

- **Realistic Ball Physics**: Watch as the balls move realistically, influenced by gravity and collision detection.
- **Interactive Environment**: Click and drag to create force fields and interact with the balls.
- **Special Effects**: Enjoy special effects like particle systems and dynamic lighting.

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Pygame by running `pip install pygame` in your command line.
3. Run `main.py` to start the game.
4. Use your mouse to interact with the balls and environment.
